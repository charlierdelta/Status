Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have completed a basic asteroid game with asteroids that break apart when shot until they are destroyed. 
Asteroids and the player ship can traverse from one end of the screen to the other, ie if either an asteroid or the ship is travelling left and hits the left edge of the screen it shows up at the same y position on the right side of the screen still travelling left. The same applies for the top, bottom, and right edges of the screen.
A bullet fires from wherever the ship is heading. If it hits an edge the bullet I considered that a miss and remove it from play. If it hits an asteroid the asteroid either breaks into two smaller asteroids with different headings, or is completely destroyed depending on the size of the asteroid.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't gotten to the personal touch/extra component of the project.
Have not added different stages/areas to travel/explore/play in.
Have not added different weapon mechanics.
Have not added different asteroid types.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

No major problems worth mentioning.
